This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

Analysis :

Gender Distribution:

There are 87 females and 157 males.
This indicates that there are almost twice as many male diners as female diners in the dataset.

Bill Amounts:

The highest bill was $50.81.
The lowest bill was $3.07.
The average bill was $19.78.
This suggests a wide range of dining expenses, with the average bill being around $20.

Tip Amounts:

The highest tip was $10.
The lowest tip amount was $1, which was paid 4 times.
The average tip was about $3.
This indicates that most customers leave tips around 15% of the average bill.

Dining by Day:

Saturday has the most diners with 87.
Friday has the fewest diners with 19.
The average number of diners per day is 61.
This large discrepancy suggests that weekends, especially Saturdays, are the busiest days for dining, while Fridays are relatively slow.
Detailed Analysis

Gender and Day Distribution:

Saturdays and Sundays: Highest turnout for males.
Thursdays and Saturdays: Highest turnout for females.
Thursdays: Even distribution of male and female diners.
This could indicate that different days of the week attract different demographics.
Group Diners:

Despite Saturdays having the highest number of diners, Sundays have the highest number of group diners (3 or more people per party).
This suggests that Sundays may be preferred for family or group outings, while Saturdays could be popular for individual or smaller group dining.
